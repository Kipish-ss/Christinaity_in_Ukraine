<p>This visualization was concerned with answering the question of how the percentage of people of different branches of Christianity in Ukraine has changed from 2000 to 2015 and how many people of different branches of Christianity are there in each region (as of 2015). Wikipedia article about religion in Ukraine was used to scrape data concerning religions by year and religions by oblast in Ukraine (which was then converted to religions by region dataset). Any other religion except for Christianity was dropped from both of the datasets. Religions by oblast in Ukraine dataset was grouped by region, averaging the percentage of believers for each of the branches. Since this dataset concerns 2015, religion by year dataset was limited to 2015 as an upper bound. The left plot indicates an increasing trend of Orthodox Christians in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015 and their much greater overall percentage compared to the other branches. Latin Catholics' and Greek Catholics' percentage change really slightly over 2000-2015 period, while there was a rapid growth of Christians who do not specify themselves in 2005. The right plot again indicates that the majority of Christians in Ukraine are Orthodox, however, there is a considerable amount of Greek Catholics on the West in comparison to other regions. Other branches have similar percentage regardless of the region.</p>
